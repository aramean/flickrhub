# FlickrHub
A lightweight and interactive photo gallery built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app fetches images from an external API and dynamically displays them in a responsive, user-friendly grid. It supports searching, infinite scrolling, and viewing larger images, making it a simple yet effective tool for browsing and discovering photos. The backend is powered by C#, handling API requests, authentication, and data processing to ensure a smooth and efficient experience.
